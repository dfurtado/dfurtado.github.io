        <p>
        I started my carreer back in 1998 working on a Bioinformatics laboratory at the Ludwig Institute for
        Cancer Research where I would spend almost 10 years developing web applications and tools in Perl,
        Python and C for Unix and Linux systems. After moving to Sweden in 2006, I switched over to .NET with focus
        in front-end development.</p>
        <p>
        On my spare time I like to watch horror movies and play video games. I also have been playing drums
        professionaly for many years and I have had the opportunity to go on tour around Europe having fun
        and meeting interesting people along the way.
