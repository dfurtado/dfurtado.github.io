I’ve just released a Django single page application generator for Yeoman, if you are not familiar with Yeoman 
project, you can read more here: [http://yeoman.io/](http://yeoman.io/)]

The Django Single Page Application generator creates a Django project structure, download all the project’s 
client-side dependencies (Jquery, Bootstrap, Angular JS), creates the application template using bootstrap 
and it will also create all the Angular JS boilerplate code (module, controllers and routes) 
to speed your development up.

The generator-djangospa is a opensource project distributed under MIT license.
