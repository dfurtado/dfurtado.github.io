I’m a Brazilian system developer from São Paulo based in Stockholm, Sweden.  I like to code awesome stuff, 
drink coffee and play video games.

My passion for development and technology started quite early when I was about 9 years old, my parents gave 
me an Atari 2600 and it literally blew me away, it was amazing for me that I could control something on the 
TV screen and that made me wonder: How the hell do they do that? A few years later one of my friends got a TK90 
computer (also known as Zx Spectrum in the UK) that was my first real contact with a computer and programming 
and we would spend hours typing basic code from computer magazines.

The first computer I’ve got was around 1993 it was a PC with Intel 80486DX2 processor not very powerful but 
it was enough for me to decide that programming was what I wanted to do. That year I also attended my first 
programming course to learn Clipper. At that time I also started a BBS only for fun and to share files and 
chat with my friends. I joined the university in 1996 where I got really interested in C programming, Java and 
I also started a Linux club together with a few classmates, to talk about Linux, share knowledge and organize 
install days and so on.

I started my career in 1997 working as a Clipper developer in a big company in São Paulo and after that I’ve 
worked with different technologies in different companies but most of my first 10 years has been working with 
Bioinformatics, where I developed a passion for script languages, more specifically Perl. For the past 7 years 
I’ve been working with .NET but I also love other technologies like Python, C++, Java and JavaScript.

On my free time, I like to develop games (right now I’m working on a game in C++ using SDL), skateboarding, 
snowboarding, hang out with my family and of course play video games.
